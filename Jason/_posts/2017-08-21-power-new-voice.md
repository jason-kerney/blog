## TL; DR

Too often the person with the least experience is ignored. This is a shame because they are often the person who can lead us to the most significant insights. They will see things we overlook or have become accustomed to. They can help us question the things we have started to not question. They are a powerful voice for improvement.

## Question Everything

Like [@WoodyZuil](https://twitter.com/WoodyZuill) says: [“Any method or practice we use without question should be questioned.”](https://twitter.com/WoodyZuill/status/881711076089384964)

The problem is if we are practicing something without question, we can often be blind to the fact that we are practicing it without question. A new set of eyes can see these things, but we must encourage them to point them out. If not, we risk that they too will become accustomed before we have gained benefit from their newness.

## Intimidation

The problem with capturing input from someone who is new, is that most people do not feel comfortable giving feedback while they are new. This means that we must be extra careful to foster that feedback. It is something that must be intentional.

The first step is listening. When a new person offers input, listen. Use both [Active Listening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_listening) and [Comprehensive Listening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informational_listening). Do not interrupt, and take a moment before replying. This shows respect for what they have to say, and consideration of their point.

The next is to treat the comment and question as if it is valid, and wanted feedback. They may not understand all the context to the thing they are questioning. That is the point. Do not explain to them how they are wrong, instead explain to them how they are right. That does not mean that you do not explain your context, but instead use it understand what they offer.

## What if they are wrong?

They will often be wrong. The suggestion, or question, will be wrongly worded. They will most likely not understand what it is that made them feel the way they felt. Don’t let the fact that what they say is wrong stop you from learning. Instead, examine the situation. There will be truth there, and that truth will lead to improvement.

At the worst case, if they are utterly wrong then you will have provided the opportunity to learn in a way that makes them feel appreciated. This learning will be retained longer. It will encourage them to voice more, and thereby learn more. Eventually they will teach you something, because they are willing to voice what they don’t understand.

## The Warning of a Silent Voice

Pay attention to what is happening regarding the new voice. If that voice is silent, this is a waring. It means that there is something that is causing that person to fall silent. It means that the team is not welcoming that person’s insights, and not listening and accepting of what the new voice offers.

This is the loudest indicator you will often get to small problems on a team. These problems can- not always, but definitely often enough- grow into big noisy, and explosive problems if not handled at this point. 

## In Closing

It is hard to listen to the point of view of a new person. That person may not know the social norms, or the current environment. It is easy to just brush off what they say, as they do not know better. However, when we do ignore the “new voice” we lose a lot of valuable insight.
