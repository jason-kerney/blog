## Overview ##

If you’re a new manager, team lead, or senior dev trying to build better problem-solving habits, this is for you. However, these patterns work cross-functionally across different roles. There is benefit for UX, product, or others using these patterns.

I have been a manager since December 2023. The biggest problem I have encountered is that of "solutions". Solutions present an interesting problem for development teams. Solutions are often presented by helpful individuals who are both the within the team and those who support the team (including me). These solutions are often presented without the context of the problem they are intended to fix. In some cases, it is a mistaken assumption that we are all on the same page. Other times, it is because the problem feels irrelevant once we have a solution. In the worst case, it is because the person giving the solution does not actually understand the context of the problem they are trying to solve.

However, in all cases, the solution without the context of the problem it is intended to solve causes more problems.

Here is what you will take from this article:
* Solutions without a clearly understood problem often cause more harm than good.
* Our instinct to fix things quickly can prevent us from truly listening and understanding.
* Implementing a solution without context leads to misaligned action and broken systems.
* Instead of rushing to fix, focus first on understanding—the solution will be better for it


## The Problems with Solutions ##

Let's delve into this in more detail. You cannot solve problems without some solution. Right? Well, yes, you are right. However, there are downsides to always looking to "solve" a problem.

Having a problem is well a problem. People desire to solve a problem when we see it. This is so prevalent that many people feel discomfort to having a problem linger without a solution even for a small amount of time. I am one of those people. This leads me to communicate about a problem through the application of a solution I propose. To be clear, I often explain the existence of a problem through the description of the solution. This would not be so bad if I did not see other people do the same thing. The problem is we have so many people focused on proposing a solution we often don't adequately describe the problem it is meant to solve.

This issue is further compounded when the individuals responsible for implementing the solution have limited understanding beyond the solution itself. Here we get a different kind of issue with a solution that is closely related to the first. Remember I am someone who feels uncomfortable when in the presence of an unsolved problem. This often leads me to not even to think to ask more detail on the original problem when presented with a solution. Instead, I dig into the solution. I want more detail about the the how of the solution. The how is a comfortable place, it eliminates the need for the problem. This makes me feel as if I understand the problem it solves. However, now my understanding is at best flawed, because I am left to guess the original problem. When I go to execute the solution, I will definitely run into something not described in the solution, and act in accordance to the problem I thought the solution was trying to solve. I am often wrong in my guess of the original problem. Since my understanding is flawed then my actions in accordance with the problem will be flawed.

This would not be much of an issue if I was the only person who acted this way. The problem is I see many—if not most—people act this way. Even those, like me who know it is a ineffective way to act.

Now if these were the only issues with solutions it would bad enough, but there are still more issues with solutions. Remember that I do not like being in the presence of an unsolved problem. Well, when someone presents me with an unsolved problem, I start solutioning. Sometimes I am polite and do this in my head. Sometimes I am more invigorated by the problem and interrupt the speaker to present my solution. Either way, I have stopped listening and started trying to fix the situation. Often, because the person explaining the problem also does not like having unsolved problems, I lure them into the process of "finding" a solution.

Not taking into consideration the whole of a problem will cause the solution to miss key aspects of the problem. Like a stopper that mostly fits a drain, you may not be able to tell that the solution is a poor fit for the problem. Human systems, are far more complicated then a sink and a drain, which causes an ill fitting solution to appear good for some time. The problems this ill fit cause may even not be directly linked to the original problem. These ill fit solutions break the systems they are intended to fix and break them in ways that may be undetectable and impossible to link to its cause.

In the worst case scenario, we shutdown people. We encourage learned helplessness. We actively kill creativity.

## How to Shift the Focus ##

I am not saying that we should never try and find a solution, or that we should just let problems exist. On the contrary, I believe we should solve them. However, solutions require timing. We need to resist building a solution until it is time.

If we rely on someone else to implement a solution give them the ability to own, it. Ensure that they understand the problem fully before they start working to solve the problem. Do not allow solutions to be presented until you know they fully understand the problem. You are allowed to help craft the solution but resist the temptation to bring a solution pre-made.

If we are presented with a problem to solve, resist the urge to jump right in. Take time to ensure you grasp not only the problem being presented but also if and what are the deeper problems. Solving them will most likely lead to a healthier solution all around. Try asking "How is the immediate problem really a symptom?" Or, "What hidden problems could cause what I am facing right now?"

Don't delay irresponsibly. Act as fast as the problem warrants, but make sure your first action is to understand the problem as well as you can in the time you have. Only when you understand or have run out of time to understand, then start finding a solution.

## Practicing What I Preach (Imperfectly) ##

These things are easier said than done. I struggle with presenting problems to people within my team and without. Those I manage, bring me solutions and I find myself tangled within those solution until I realize what has happened. People bring those who I manage solutions all the time.

Throughout all of this, I have observed all the aforementioned problems except for Learned Helplessness, although I fear it may arise in the future.

I am working to draw everyone's attention to the problems that are just behind the solutions. Even the solutions that pretend to be just tasks. I have not found a great way to prevent me from falling prey to solutions or solutioning, yet I am trying to help others.

I admit to people when I notice I was called to a solution to early. I apologize, though most seem to think it is not needed.

## The Goal ##

> Don't let perfect be the enemy of good.
> Voltaire

Solutions have a seductive allure that persists. The goal is not to never fall prey to them, but to try and catch yourself sooner each time.
