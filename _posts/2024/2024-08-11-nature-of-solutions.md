## Overview ##

## Setup ##

I have been a manager since December 2023. This is something I never wanted but am so glad I got to experience. I went from never managing, but coaching before, to managing a very large team overnight. I was familiar with this team as some time prior I was a developer on that team. I then became an agile coach and worked with that team in that capacity for almost a year. I was then moved to help another team for a year.

This context is important because a development team can undergo significant changes within a year. In fact there are a lot of changes that started when I was coach that led the team to be where they were when I took over as their manager.

Before stepping into the role, I purchased several books and read them. Some were on what to expect as a new manager. Some were on what to expect as a new technical manager. Others were on how to be better in both those contexts.

As it turns out, the challenges I encountered were more nuanced and diverse than what those books had conveyed. Though there were a plethora of things I had to figure out, I want to really focus in on one particular type of thing that kept causing me problems. That one thing was "Solutions".

## The Problems with Solutions ##

Let me setup things to be fair here. The problems I had with solutions did not all come from outside of me. And not all those problems came from within either. They came from all over. From good intentioned individuals doing the best they know how. They came out of shadows when I thought I had relief from them. They came out of my dreams when I slept. But they always caused problems.

Now, let's delve into this in more detail. You cannot solve problems without some solution. Right? Well, yes, you are right. However, there are downsides to always looking to "solve" a problem. So, letâ€™s get into it.

Having a problem is well a problem. People in, at least in Southern California, desire to solve a problem when we see it. This is so prevalent that many people feel discomfort to having a problem linger without a solution even for a small amount of time. I am one of those people. This leads me to communicate about a problem through the application of a solution I propose. This would not be so bad if I did not see other people do the same thing. The problem is we have so many people focused on proposing a solution we often don't adequately describe the problem it is meant to solve.

This issue is further compounded when the individuals responsible for implementing the solution have limited understanding beyond the solution itself. Here we get a different kind of issue with a solution that is closely related to the first. Remember I am someone who feels uncomfortable when in the presence of an unsolved problem. This often leads me to not even to think to ask more detail on the original problem when presented with a solution. Instead, I dig into the solution. I want more detail about the solution. This makes me feel as if I understand the problem it solves. However, now my understanding is flawed. When I go to execute the solution, I will definitely run into something not described in the solution, and act in accordance to the problem I thought the solution was trying to solve. Since my understanding is flawed then my actions in accordance with the problem will be flawed.

This would not be much of an issue if I was the only person who acted this way. The problem is I see a lot, if not majority of people act this way. Even those, like me who know it is a flawed way to act.

Now if these were the only issues with solutions it would bad enough, but there are still more issues with solutions. Remember that I do not like being in the presence of an unsolved problem. Well, when someone presents me with an unsolved problem, I start solutioning. Sometimes I am polite and do this in my head. Sometimes I am more invigorated by the problem and interrupt the speaker to present my solution. Either way, I have stopped listening and started trying to fix the situation. Often, because the person explaining the problem also does not like having unsolved problems, I lure them into the process of "finding" a solution.

Furthermore, this issue becomes more insidious. You see, under the best circumstance, a solution that isn't a good match will often hide. It will work enough to make us feel well but also have slight cracks that will appear at a later time or even elsewhere in the system. It will be separated by enough time and distance we will believe we did not cause it. If we are lucky, we will be able to trace it back to the half developed solution.

In the worst case scenario, we shutdown people. We encourage learned helplessness. We actively kill creativity.

## Well Then What? ##

I am not saying that we should never try and find a solution, or that we should just let problems exist. On the contrary, I believe we should solve them. However, solutions require timing. We need to resist building a solution until it is time.

If we rely on someone else to implement a solution give them the ability to own, it. Ensure that they understand the problem fully before they start working to solve the problem. Do not allow solutions to be presented until you know they fully understand the problem. You are allowed to help craft the solution but resist the temptation to bring a solution pre-made.

If we are presented with a problem to solve, resist the urge to jump right in. Take time to ensure you grasp not only the problem being presented but also if and what are the deeper problems. Solving them will most likely lead to a healthier solution all around.

Don't delay irresponsibly. Act as fast as the problem warrants, but make sure your first action is to understand the problem as well as you can in the time you have. Only when you understand or have run out of time to understand, then start finding a solution.

## In My Case ##

These things are easier said than done. I struggle with presenting problems to people within my team and without. Those I manage, bring me solutions and I find myself tangled within those solution until I realize what has happened. People bring those who I manage solutions all the time.

Throughout all of this, I have observed all the aforementioned problems except for Learned Helplessness, although I fear it may arise in the future.

I am working to draw everyone's attention to the problems that are just behind the solutions. Even the solutions that pretend to be just tasks. I have not found a great way to prevent me from falling prey to solutions or solutioning, yet I am trying to help others.

I admit to people when I notice I was called to a solution to early. I apologize, though most seem to think it is not needed.

## The Goal ##

Solutions have a seductive allure that persists. The goal is not to never fall prey to them, but to try and catch yourself sooner each time.
