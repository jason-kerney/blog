## Overview ##

I have been asked many times to describe my process for continuous improvement. Most people expect me to talk about some process or way I view the team's processes. However, the approach I have is much more holistic, and much more succinct. Everything, from writing code, to deciding what to work on next, to parenting all have the same philosophy. I focus on pain, and permanently removing it. I call this Philosophy "Pain Driven Development".

## What is Pain Driven Development ##

First and foremost, I do not advocate for the creation of more pain in a development process. There is almost always way more then anyone can handle. There is usually so much pain in everything we do that we often become accustomed to that pain, and even stop noticing that it hurts.

Pain Driven Development is a philosophy of radically removing pain. Removal of pain is not easy, but in general it follows 3 steps that sound easy.

1. Draw attention to pain, and increase how much it hurts.
1. Remove the probable cause of the pain.
   * Ensure you are removing the cause, not the thing making it visible and painful. It is much easier to hide the pain.
     * Scenario: If an objective requires a external team for the objective to be met. Then the relationship, and ownership issues need to be addressed before that pain is removed. Simply calling the objective done because your team did their part hides the pain.
1. Reorganize the solution for the pain such that it is easy for you, or your team, to execute on and insure that the pain does not come back.

## Step 1: Make the Pain Visible ##

For years, I had a bad knee caused by a broken foot. I broke the foot when I was 14, and it never healed right. When in my 30's I went to the doctor for knee pain and she told me my knee should have been in agony considering how long I had the underlying injury. She told me that my gait was all messed up because I was the best at coping with an injury she had ever seen. However, I was messing up my back as well as my knee from the way I walked.

I had a problem, the original pain of my foot not healing correctly was messing up my body. This was happening because I had adapted to hide the pain. I was not even aware I was doing this. I "removed" the pain by changing the way I walked so I would not feel it. Instead I lived for 16+ years with a pain that was causing me to hurt in other places.

If I had not adapted, and it hurt to walk, I would not have knee or back problems now. Instead I would have gone to the doctor, and gotten the very easy and inexpensive solution of medical inserts for my shoes much earlier.

The first step in improving is to make anything that causes pain actually hurt. The hurt gives us impetus to make changes.

## Step 2: Remove the Cause of the Pain ##

In the story above I do not remove the cause of my pain for 16+ years when I go to a doctor and they give me medical inserts for my shoes. It is important to call out the fact that I changed the way I walked for that whole time because it relieved the pain of walking for me. When we try and fix a problem we often try to fix the thing that makes the problem visible. It is as important for small non-medical pains as it was for the small pain I experienced when I walked correctly.

So try to remove the actual pain not the thing that shows that the pain exists.

## Step 3: Reorganize ##

Having a solution isn't enough. In my story, get prescribe the medical inserts for my shoes does not into itself does not prevent my pain. I need to reorganize my life to where my shoes more. I need to move my inserts when I get new shoes, and a host of other things change. I need these changes to be integrated into what I do, and not get into my why.

## Side Note: Test Driven Development ##

The astute reader who knows Test Driven Development (TDD) will notice the similarities. This is not coincidental, in fact TDD is a sub process of Pain Driven Development. Here the original pain is that the software does not deliver a need of the customer. The test makes that pain apparent. The code removes the pain. Refactoring that code reorganizes the solution to make it easier to live with.
