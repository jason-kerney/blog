I believe I suffered from [Imposter Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) for most of my career, and if there is one thing I can say I have definitely learned is that you are the star. No matter your experience level, language, or technology bent; the fact that you are out there producing code makes you a star.

If you are not producing code: do so. I can promise you one sure thing: No code you write will ever be as bad as some of the code I have personally put into production. I wrote some things when I was a junior programmer that would make the faint of heart faint. Trust me, I had to run a production application in debug because a variable would lose its value. To keep the program working I would have to edit the memory location and then hit continue.

But that is the beauty of code. It is so valuable that even the worst written application, if it meets its basic need, will be profitable. The application above was so successful that the companyâ€™s competitors would hire us to do the work under their name.

Code is value. As long as you are producing code you are producing value.

Now I am in no way saying to stop learning, or searching for a better way. However, I am saying that you should go and produce. Build something, either for yourself or someone else. When you are done, build something else.

Searching for perfection will not help you discover that you belong. It will, in fact, do the opposite. Only by cutting your teeth on code will you begin to see the value you bring to the community.
