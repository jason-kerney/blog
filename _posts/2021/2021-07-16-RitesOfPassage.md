## TL; DR

_Rites of Passage_ help people transition through periods of uncertainty by both giving them a known and accepted routine to focus on and by signaling to the individual and group that a change has happened. The use of rites of passage have been well documented in sociology and psychology in helping people with transitions. Therefore, it makes since that businesses utilize these methods to help teams and individuals with change. However, in my experience they do not. This is a chance for companies, agile coaches, and individuals to start thinking about rites of passage and how they can be harnessed for good.

## What is a _Rite of Passage_

[Merriam-Webster's Dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rite%20of%20passage) defines it as:

> : a ritual, event, or experience that marks or constitutes a major milestone or change in a person's life.

[Psychology Wiki](https://psychology.wikia.org/wiki/Rites_of_passage) has it defined as:

> A rite of passage is a ritual that marks a change in a person's social status. It is a universal phenomenon which can show anthropologists what social hierarchies, values and beliefs are important in specific cultures.

What both of these have in common is that they are an experience that marks a major milestone or transition in someoneâ€™s life.

## Why do I care

Rites of passage help with reducing uncertainty for both the person who is going through the rite, and for both the groups who are affected by the person's transition. This means it helps the individual and groups manage the transition in a predictable and reliable way without negatively affecting the morale of any of the people affected by the transition. In other words, it can help make a transition event more successful.

In [Rebecca Lester](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/anthropology-in-mind/202005/the-importance-ritual)'s article in `Psychology Today` she talks about how simple things like getting to ready for work were a rite of daily passage to help someone transition into a work environment from a home environment. In [Bernadetta Janusz and Maciej Walkiewicz](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6105198/)'s paper they describes how rites of passage are helping cancer patients deal with the stress of their diagnostics.

Yes, none of the definitions specifically call out work transitions, but the stress we are trying to manage in work transitions falls somewhere between the extremes of going to work and being diagnosed with cancer. As such, I do believe that well thought out rites of passage can help in the workplace.

## What Can I do

The first thing is to realize that even small transitions in the workplace come with stress. It is the responsibility of leaders to think about and mitigate that stress as well as they can. The idea of a rite of passage can be a valuable tool in the tool kit of someone in a role.

## Be Warned

It is easy to use any tool as a weapon. What is worse is when we are talking about social tools, it is easier and easy to do unintentionally. We must be mindful of context, the people involved and how power is perceived and distributed through a system as well as what our intent is. **_Never_** build and design social tools in a vacuum. Things like this need to be reviewed by people with many different backgrounds, ethnic groups, and people that differ from you as possible to ensure you have something that is respectful of people. Then have it review by people in different roles and within the organization to ensure you are respecting the context.

## My Plan

In the following articles I plan to cover some of the common events in business that cause people to enter into a time of uncertainty. I believe that focusing on those events through a lens of a rite of passage will help us craft a better way to handle such things.
