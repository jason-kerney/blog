## TL; DR

Crucial conversations are hard, because they are made crucial by being unfavorable but necessary. If we ignore consent during these conversations we greatly reduce their ability to be successful. Consent is based on trust, the feeling of control, and an explicit request.

## Basics

### Context

A crucial conversation is a conversation intended to deliver unfavorable news and sometimes change behavior related to that news. Each of these goals are very different, but engagement by the person in the conversation greatly improves chances of success. Engagement relies on trust. Trust relies on consent.

To have this conversation, we will need meaningful consent. If you are curious about what I mean by "meaning full" consent you can read the [first]({{ related.url }}) post in this series.

### Why Consent

Since this is a professional blog about professional workplaces, I can imagine someone saying that "This conversation has to happen so why do I need consent". Well that depends on our goal. If our goal is to have a meaningful impact on the person's life and ensure we are understood, then consent allows us to begin that process. If our goal is to fulfil HR and legal requirements so that we can fire the person, then strictly speaking consent is not needed; though it can help.

## Trust

Trust is the first step in gaining consent. It is important that the person trusts that the conversation is coming from a selfless perspective. They need to understand the situation that brings the conversation to bear, and know that you are trying to ensure their best welfare. They need to trust you and your motives.

## Option to Opt Out

With crucial conversations, giving the option to opt out is the hardest part. It starts with the recognition that the person already has that option. They can choose to not listen to what is said. They have the option to implicitly opt out by not listening, all we are doing here is making that option explicit. The next part is even harder. Explaining what will happen if they opt out without sounding like a veiled threat. It is important that the person is aware of the consequences, but made to understand that those results are not dependent on participation in the conversation but rather dependent on the effects of either behavior not changing or not being given the information.

When we are approaching from a position of power it becomes even harder not to sound like a threat and more care must be taken. Taking time to ensure that you are not self-centered throughout the conversation will greatly help with this.

## The Option to Challenge

When we engage in a crucial conversation, we are making a big assumption. We are assuming we have some knowledge of the situation that the recipient does not have, and would benefit from. We need to also approach this with the assumption that the person will have knowledge we do not have, and that we will benefit from. This will make gaining consent easier, if they trust that they can challenge what is said in a meaningful way.

If the person has no way to challenge, it will be harder to gain consent, but if you are honest about that it still can help.

## Remember to Ask

Once you have layed the ground work, you cannot assume you have consent. You need to ask. This is the most crucial part of this. By asking for permission you are gaining a chance to be truly heard.
