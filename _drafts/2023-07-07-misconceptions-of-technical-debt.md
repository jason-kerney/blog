## Overview

This is a guest blog written by David Brown.

Technical debt, often mistaken as an IT tax, is a strategic tool used to limit immediate investment in risky decisions while understanding the future payoff. This post challenges the traditional notion of technical debt, emphasizing its importance as a strategic lever rather than a simple coding issue. It advocates for shifting the ownership of tech debt from ‘developers’ to product leaders, as they are better equipped to navigate business-oriented discussions and manage strategic trade-offs. The article emphasizes treating technical debt as a strategic variable, similar to how one might take on a mortgage or a car loan, to be managed over time. In short, technical debt is not a burden but a strategic instrument that, when used wisely, can enhance productivity and value delivery.

## Introduction

Technical debt, a term often bandied about in the world of software development, is commonly misunderstood and misused[^1]. It's easy to simply classify poorly written code as 'technical debt', but this narrow view is reductive, and it obscures the true strategic value of this concept[^2].

## The True Meaning of Technical Debt

Coined by Ward Cunningham, the concept of 'technical debt' refers to the implicit cost of additional rework that stems from choosing an easy (and potentially flawed) solution now, instead of a better, and perhaps more time-consuming one[^3]. Much like financial debt, technical debt is not inherently evil. Just as a mortgage allows you to own a house immediately by spreading out payments over time, technical debt allows teams to deliver software solutions promptly, albeit with a promise of future investment.

This doesn't imply recklessly creating flawed code. Instead, it refers to a strategic decision where we knowingly limit investment in the short term due to risks or resource constraints, while understanding that there will be a payoff in the future to rectify this decision.

## Shifting the Ownership of Technical Debt

This strategic aspect of technical debt necessitates a shift in how we perceive its ownership. Instead of burdening developers, product managers should own, map, and manage technical debt. This transition necessitates a fundamental shift in perception, but it's crucial for two reasons:

Product managers are the nexus of business needs, user needs, and technical capabilities, making them best suited to manage this strategic trade-off.  Tech debt often comes with a cost to future development velocity, user experience, or even revenue, thus requiring frequent business-oriented discussions that product managers are better equipped to handle.

## Product Managers: The Debt Strategists

As we move the ownership of technical debt to product managers, they should weave it into their daily conversations with the technical teams. Much like a homeowner planning to pay down a mortgage, product managers need to understand and strategically plan to 'pay down' technical debt over time.

This requires product managers to understand the codebase well enough to map out technical debt, while prioritizing it against new features, improvements, or bug fixes. Clear, open communication between product managers and the tech team is crucial to ensure that the benefits and drawbacks of incurring or repaying tech debt are understood and accepted by all stakeholders.

## Embracing Technical Debt

Technical debt, much like financial debt, is not always negative. When managed strategically, it can empower teams to deliver immediate value and capitalize on opportunities, while planning for future improvements.

By shifting the ownership of tech debt from developers to product managers, we can ensure it's treated as a strategic variable, not a code problem. This shift helps organizations develop a culture where technical debt is not a burden, but a tool that, if wielded wisely, can enhance productivity and value delivery.

So let's cast off the common misconceptions of technical debt and appreciate its strategic importance. Let's foster open conversations around it and integrate it into our strategic planning. Let's embrace technical debt as a strategic instrument, for that's what it truly is
