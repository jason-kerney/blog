## TL;DR

Human systems are at best a complex system. When we try and change that system we need to respect that system, and understand it. Making changes that focus on simple answers but ignoring the complex parts of the system is inviting failure.

I have been threw several failed agile transformations and one successful one. To say that a transformation failed does not say every aspect of it failed, but that in the end the company was in a worse spot then they were before the transformation. These transformations have been at different stages of my career and learning path. That being said, this blog is not intended to be a end all blog on transformation failure or recipes, only a look at what I have seen throughout my career and what I learned from that.

## Simplicity

Simplicity is a core agile tenet; defined as "Maximizing the work not done." This can be tricky though, particularly when dealing with [wicked problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem). The problem I see, is people are looking for a "Simple solution" rather then a "Simple way to find our solution". (I speak from experience here ðŸ™‚)

By focusing on the simple solution, we ignore the complexity of the domain. We ignore the people involved. And we ignore effort real change will take. We must remember that a system behaves exactly as it is designed to be behave. People who are trying to accomplish goals will find ways to optimize around achieving those goals. We may not understand every way the system is optimized; we may never understand. Worse of all as we change a system we are inherently removing the rewards people got for working the way they work.

So we turn to a different tool. The [Cynefin Framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_framework) can give guidance here. If we are not in firefighting mode, then we are most likely working in a "Complex" environment. Cynefin, suggests that when in a complex environment we must probe, sense and then respond. Meaning that we make a change, wait to see how the system reacts to that change, and where the system lands after it reacts. Once we know that, we can then try another change with the hopes of getting closer to what we want. If this sounds familiar, you may have heard a talk on [retrospectives]({{ related.url }}) or two.

If however we find ourselves in a firefighting mode, we are probably operating in a chaotic domain. This means we do not have time probe the system. So Cynefin suggest we act, sense, and then respond. We act first because things are critical and urgent. But this is an action based off of pressure and need, not data. We then sense. Was this the correct action? Finally we respond, by either acting to fix the problems we caused, or to tackle the next biggest critical and urgent thing on our plate.

## Human Systems are Systems

Human systems are systems and as such they obey all the natural laws of systems. The one that is often ignored is that _all_ systems seek equilibrium. Once in equilibrium it takes significant amount of energy to find a new equilibrium, often an order of magnitude more energy. Before that new equilibrium is found the system tries to revert back to a state that requires a lower amount of energy. Often that is a previous state, but might also be a state of where the system disintegrates.

When trying to alter a human system we need to take the whole system into account. We need to respect the system, and look for the correct lever. In ["The Fifth Discipline"](https://www.amazon.com/Fifth-Discipline-Practice-Learning-Organization/dp/0385517254) Peter Senge diagrams a number of ways that human systems work, and how to find their leverage point. A leverage point as described by him, is a point where a system is subject to change with little to no effort. These are points that are already setup to amplify effort in the system and can therefore be used to modify how a system behaves.

When we take these common human system patterns and their leverage points into consideration we gain a lot of control of that system. When we don't we pour a lot of energy into a system and the best we can hope for is the desolation of the system.

## Culture

You have heard that culture eats process for lunch. This is usually hurled as a pithy remark that you must change culture if you want to change process. However, changing culture is not a pithy effort. When you look at culture there are a lot of inputs and outputs that form feedback loops. Culture is a human system within a human system. We need to look for leverage points, make small changes and determine if that change lead to favorable outcomes.

But how do you change culture at the leverage points? You cannot tell people that their culture is now different.

### Follows Structure

Culture follows structure, especially informal structure. That means you can determine structure by examining culture. It also means that by changing structure we _will_ change culture. However some changes will reinforce culture by strengthening what is already there. So not every change to structure is equal and you have to think about simplicity and systems when changing structure.

### Follows Rewards

Rewards are an insidious system that exists within companies. They are insidious because they are "simple" switches that effect behavior and often in unanticipated ways. Moreover rewards effect how someone sees success in their role and can become tied to one's own identity. Changing rewards are often one of the things that cause resistance in transformations. That being said they are a powerful influencer to culture. Changing a reward structure will change the underlying culture, but again do so with care as you will not know what its outcome is until it is over.

### Is Slow to Change

Culture is built over years. When a change is made with the intent to change culture, that change will need to filter through the system. It will cause ripples and eddies as the system tries to find its new equilibrium. You have to be patient and wait for those perturbations die out and a new normal is established. Determining success or failure while the system is still oscillating is a sure fire way to miss the truth.
