## TL; DR



## What is Scale

When you are talking about gaining consent of a group, scale is measured along 2 different axis. The number of contexts, and the amount of time.

For example, if you are working with a number of individuals with very disparate points of view things you do that will gain trust from one group may cost you trust from another. Also, the longer a change takes to happen, the more resentment toward that change will grow.

## Where to Start

In an earlier article, I talked about gaining [{{change.title}}]({{ change.url }}). However, it leaves a lot of questions unanswered when talking about large scale change. If you have not read the article, I recommend you read it before this one, as I will be building on the ideas presented there.

Everything about gaining consent is still true for large scale change. So you start there. You need to build trust, allow for a person to opt-out, and listen to them. From there you will work at reducing our two main complexity variables, number of contexts, and time.

## Partition Change to Gain Trust

Every change happens in steps and efforts with gradient returns. Rather then trying to gain upfront consent for everything that is about to happen approach it in bite sized pieces. Gain consent, for individual changes within individual contexts. This will reduce both the time and number of contexts you are working with. Another benefit to seeking consent to as small of changes as possible, is you can better describe what is happening and therefore build trust.

Large changes happen in small movements and so does large scale consent.

## Focus on Being Trustworthy

It is too easy to get caught up in the benefits that a change may bring. When we speak too much on those, we start to sound like a sales person. Remember to gain trust we need to reduce the amount of self centeredness. We need to be focused on the individuals who are going to be affected by the change. This is even more so when dealing with change at scale as those affected become more and more difficult to see as individuals.

So you need to take time and really focus on being worthy of people's trust so that they can give you their trust, and eventually their consent.

## Consent at Scale

Is really about consent and not really about scale.
