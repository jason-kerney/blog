## TL; DR

... Change threatens belonging, we need to address this to stay human.

## Change is Risky

Lets simplify the conversation for the moment. Lets only talk about changes that were planned and have a positive intent. Don't worry I will get to the other kinds of changes later on. For now, positive intent and preplanning help us to frame a few ideas.

Virginia Satir published a paper describing how, individual, families, teams, and even organizations move through a positive intended change. Shortly after the change takes effect there is a period of chaos, where things are often worse then the initial conditions. However, the state of affairs while in chaos change rapidly from bad to good and back again. Eventually, the cycles calm down and enter a state of integration followed by practice and finally by status quo. Each of these three states continuously improves the overall state of things until status quo.

There is a lot of focus on the idea that you will encounter chaos before everything gets better. But, assuming that everything gets better is not the point. The point is you can never know the outcome of a change until you reach a new status quo. Humans are by definition a complex system, and in complex systems inputs and out puts are separated by at least time if not by distance. This separation introduces at least 2 risks. The first is that the damage caused by the chaotic state is more severe then the intended benefit. The second is that the result is so far away that we loose sight of it.

There are other risks based on the type of change. Some of those risks are emotional, financial or even physical.

## Change means stress

So why does having risk matter? Well when change happens in it can effect the ability of employees to perform at there very best. Risk causes stress. And some changes we can do little about. But when there is a change in the workplace we can help navigate those situations and reduce stress.

In July I wrote about [Rites of Passage]({{ related.url }}). This will give me the framework I intend to use for helping people deal with work changes.

Rites of passage are really about helping individuals and groups find a new sense of belonging.
