Notes:
- Looking for simple solutions to complex problems
- All systems seek equilibrium/stasis
  - requires several orders of magnitude more energy to move a system out of stasis to new stasis
- culture eats process for breakfast
  - culture follows structure
- rewards
  - culture follows rewards


I have been threw several failed agile transformations and one successful one. To say that a transformation failed does not say every aspect of it failed, but that in the end the company was in a worse spot then they were before the transformation. These transformations have been at different stages of my career and learning path. That being said, this blog is not intended to be a end all blog on transformation failure, only a look at what I have seen throughout my career.

## Simplicity

Simplicity is a core agile tenet; defined as "Maximizing the work not done." This can be tricky though, particularly when dealing with [wicked problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem). The problem I see, is people are looking for a "Simple solution" rather then a "Simple way to find our solution". (I speak from experience here ðŸ™‚)

By focusing on the simple solution, we ignore the complexity of the domain. We ignore the people involved. And we ignore effort real change will take. We must remember that a system behaves exactly as it is designed to be behave. People who are trying to accomplish goals will find ways to optimize around achieving those goals. We may not understand every way the system is optimized; we may never understand.

So we turn to a different tool. The [Cynefin Framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_framework) can give guidance here. If we are not in firefighting mode, then we are most likely working in a "Complex" environment. Cynefin, suggests that when in a complex environment we must probe, sense and then respond. Meaning that we make a change, wait to see how the system reacts to that change, and where the system lands after it reacts. Once we know that, we can then try another change with the hopes of getting closer to what we want. If this sounds familiar, you may have heard a talk on [retrospectives]({{ related.url }}) or two.

If however we find ourselves in a firefighting mode, we are probably operating in a chaotic domain. This means we do not have time probe the system. So Cynefin suggest we act, sense, and then respond. We act first because things are critical and urgent. But this is an action based off of pressure and need, not data. We then sense. Was this the correct action? Finally we respond, by either acting to fix the problems we caused, or to tackle the next biggest critical and urgent thing on our plate.
