## TL; DR

Consent is a barrier to engagement in change management. However, basic agreement is not enough. We need to get meaningful consent to allow for engagement. That means people need to trust us first then allow us to guide the change.

## The Basics

### Context

For the purpose of this article, I will be talking about consent in regards to making changes in the work place and how to use it as an essential part of change management. This could be large re-org style changes, the running a workshop today type of change, or simply we are changing some of the office tools and or processes.

### What is Consent

At its core consent means the explicit permission to do something that involves the person who gives the permission. Though that definition is not enough. It leaves out the **why** you need consent in a work environment to do work related tasks.

Consent is really about trust. Trust first that the person has the ability not to consent, and secondly that what is about to happen will be emotionally, physically, financially, and psychologically safe.

### Why Consent

[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinkruse/2012/09/04/why-employee-engagement/?sh=7e1b2ef83aab) references a lot of research showing that when employees are engaged, they are better employees. Consent is the first barrier to engagement. If we want engagement in our change, we _need_ to start with consent.

### Meaningful Consent

Meaningful consent is where the person consents not only in word and action but emotionally and willfully. They are fully accepting of what is about to take place. They are in short fully engaged with it.

## Showing up is not enough

If our goal is engagement then we need to worry about meaningful consent. It is not enough that an employee shows up for whatever we have scheduled to facilitate the change. There are a lot of reasons a person may show up that have nothing to do with giving consent. They may be afraid of being viewed as a lesser employee when raises come out. They may be afraid of missing out. They may simply want a break from their job.

Having people in the room is a starting place to speak about consent. It gives us the opportunity to ask for consent, but we still need to ask for it.

## Words are not enough

Giving verbal or written consent does not mean you have meaningful consent. When you gain consent from a person, care must be given that they believe this consent was given without pressure. They must trust that not giving consent means they are free from the change that is about to happen.

More importantly, they need to know they can revoke consent in the future.

## Having Consent is not enough

It is important to know that many things can affect consent, and once given it can be lost. Since consent is about trust it is not universal or stagnant. Consent is a minute by minute thing, and we need to be aware of it. This means we need to check in with people throughout the change to ensure that we still have consent, especially when something in the change changes.

## Paying is not enough

It is worth noting that if you run paid training, it is not enough to assume that if someone paid to be there, that they consent. This really a subcategory of showing up.

## How do you gain consent

### Trust

There is a lot to unpack with this question. Gaining consent is all about gaining trust. When I talk about trust, I like to bring up the [Trust Equation `(credibility + reliability + intimacy) / self-orientation`](https://trustedadvisor.com/why-trust-matters/understanding-trust/understanding-the-trust-equation). [^1] I examine what I am doing and saying on this equation. The most impactful part of this equation is `self-orientation`. I need to minimize how much I am oriented on myself and my goals.

Paradoxically, for me, I find I am best at minimizing my self-orientation if I first examine what my self-orientation is. What do I have to gain from doing the thing I am doing. If I can examine this and be truthful about it it allows me to then examine what my message is and identify where I am focusing on me. The next thing I find helpful is to spend time examining why I think what I am about to do is helpful for the audience. I then examine that against my own desires. Am I masking my own desires as things that will be beneficial to the audience?

Once I have an understanding of why I think this will be beneficial to the audience of the change, then I farm for dissent. I ask people to challenge me, and I listen. Sometimes, they will raise things that are actually covered but I did not think of. Most often though, they tell me why I am wrong. I find that what I was planning is not correctly fit to the people who I am affecting. So I change, and correct the fit.

This shows vulnerability, and gives stronger agency. It corrects for my self-focus, and allows me to not only gain trust but do a better job.

### Explicitness

Once we have trust to do the change, we then need to be explicit about what is about to happen. We need to be as clear as we can be. If there is a surprise used to forward learning, we need to examine if that surprise is necessary. If it is, we need to have consent to surprise the person. The goal here is to maximize the understanding of what is going to happen, so that we minimize the chance of loosing consent at a later step.

### Consent

Once we have trust, and have been explicit about what is happening, we can then ask for consent. We need to start by giving the person an out. Describe what will be happening if they choose to abstain. Carefully word the description as not to be a veiled threat. Also, inform the person that at any time they may choose to remove their consent. Then simply ask. “Do you consent with moving forward with …”.

## Conclusion

It can be awkward and jarring to think about consent when also tied up in the how of a change. But huge rewards are there, and it does not take that much more to get them. My call to action, is spend time to get consent on the next change you make no matter how small or big.

[^1]: The trust equation is a good model, but like all models they are not always correct.
