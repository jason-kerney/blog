## TL; DR

Hiring a new employee comes with a whole lot of uncertainty that most companies do not address well. Looking at our onboarding as a rite of passage can help us address this uncertainty and simplify the means of building trust through the organization.

## Onboarding is Done Poorly

In this [Gallup](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/235121/why-onboarding-experience-key-retention.aspx) article:

> Gallup finds that only 12% of employees strongly agree that their organization does a great job onboarding new employees.

It also states:

> According to the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), employee turnover can be as much as 50% in the first 18 months of employment.

The article goes on to explain that if onboarding were done better the author believes we could see an increase in employee retention. This is a big deal and costs businesses a lot of money, time, effort, and skilled individuals.

I believe, and have antidotal evidence in support of, that better rites of passage can help here.

## It is a Time of Uncertainty

Being new to an organization is a huge time of uncertainty for the individual who was just hired. There is all the HR, legal, and benefits stuff that needs to be figured out. There is the employee's new manager and reporting structure and team that they need to mesh with. There are written and unwritten policies and norms to navigate.

But the new employee is not the only person to enter a time of uncertainty. The company enters one because they are uncertain the new hire will work out. That personâ€™s boss needs to figure out how to best help and guide the individual. Their team needs to learn how to incorporate the new person's quirks and knowledge.

All this uncertainty means that the first year, or 18 months, is a venerable minefield of unknowns.

## Dealing with the Emotional Impact of Uncertainty

Rites of passage are a psychological and sociological method that humans have used to deal with known changes that cause uncertainty. As describe in the previous article they serve to guide the individual going through a change, and those affected by the change. This reduces uncertainty by giving a known way to deal with it, and predefined signals for when the change has started and ended.

## Each Company Needs a Different Approach

In creating a rite of passage for your new employee it is important that this process consider several things that are unique to your company. The first, is the company culture you wish to promote. A good onboarding rite will help the new employee not only feel welcomed into the culture but help them feel supported and guided in learning and experiencing it over the next 18 months. This will be intended to help the employee not make simple mistakes and give them explicit place to question what they see.

Beyond company culture, there is company processes. A lot of these processes are so well known it is easy for someone to not realize when a new person does not even know the processes exists. Or that because they have not experienced it yet, they may have completely forgotten about it. A good rite of passage would help in these situations.

This also helps the company overcome some of its uncertainty.

## Each Group Needs a Different Approach

A new employee is not only joining a company, but they are also joining one or more groups within the organization. These groups have important aspects that make them unique within the company. Each of them will need their own rites of passage for new employees. Each group will have a sub-culture they will want to promote. Guiding a new employee through that sub-culture is essential. It will help them build connections and feel as if someone is there to prevent them from feeling as an outsider.

By thinking of each group, the person will be joining as a sub-culture with its own rites of passage, you bring each group closer and allow them to better deal with their uncertainty.

## Power Differentials Need to be Considered

The most basic power differential is that of role-based power. Different roles have different perceived and granted power within an organization. Dealing with these power differentials in an explicit way can help people adjust to each other when there is a power differential and trust each other despite the threat imposed by the differing power.

There are other power differentials that need to be considered. Social, economic, ethnical, and many others. The goal in examining these power differentials is a question of how do you reduce them? Even _if_ there is no intentional or unintentional bias in your company, (yes, I know that is impossible) the new person will have experienced biases outside of the company. As such your rite of passage will have to deal with that perception.

Considering power differentials in a rite of passage helps easy the uncertainty that happens when people of different perceived or granted power interact and helps them bridge that gap to form trust.

## Increased Visibility

It is true you can leave all onboarding design and action up to HR. But then you miss the true power of thinking of it as a rite of passage. You see a rite of passage serves the community, not just the leader. A rite of passage deals with people not just the requirements of law. An HR process is something that is mandated and **must** be done.  A rite of passage is something that is desired and evolved.

Worst of all, they already exist but without any formal thought or communication. Every company has an onboarding process that they are aware of, and hundreds of onboarding rites of passage they have no insight into. By making and encouraging thought about the rites of passage we want we uncover a shadow process and can course correct to improve it.

## Conclusion

Onboarding is generally not done well. It can and needs improvement. Looking at our onboarding process as a rite of passage allows us to better address the uncertainty encapsulated in hiring a new individual. It allows us to identify and target areas where a person is struggling, and better guide all involved through this period. Lastly, rites of passage for new hires already exist, but in most cases are not well thought through.

It might be worth the exercise to examine your onboarding through a lens of a rite of passage.
