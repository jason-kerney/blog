## TL; DR

_TBD_

## Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

This is sentence represent the very first value of the _[Manifesto for Agile Development](https://agilemanifesto.org/)_. Agile is and has always been about the individuals and the interactions. Yes most discussions around agile are about processes or tools for helping with agility. In-fact when you take a class on agile, they focus on these processes and tools to aid understanding. I will mention processes, even call out a few people do not realize are processes, but this post is about those pesky individuals and the interactions they have.

## Hard Things

When I learned XP, it was first though the book [XP Explained](https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Programming-Explained-Embrace-Change/dp/0321278658), and later through a really good [mentor](https://woodyzuill.com/). But the way the extreme programming practices came to be was basicity explained as these things that provided us value were hard, so we decided to do them more often. By focusing on doing them more often we figured out how to remove the difficulty and got unexpected benefits. The very first process I took away from the agile community was do hard beneficial things more until you figure out how to make them easy. Then do the new easy thing and see what rewards it reaps.

## Responding to change over following a plan

Responding to change is the last value in the _Manifesto For Agile Development_. It embodies the why of many a tool and process. The goal is to be flexible as requirements, people, and even customers change to meet the most current business need.

## What we are ignoring

I listed the three things above for a reason. I feel that [2020](https://nypost.com/list/major-2020-events/) has given us a natural experiment that the agile community can learn from; but I fear that we are ignoring the lessons that are their for us to reap.
