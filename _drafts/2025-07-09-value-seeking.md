## Overview ##

## The Problem with Grand Problems ##

Every business is plagued by large problems. These problems are easy to see, and easy to measure for those who manage the company. These are the problems the executive staff want/need to be solved, and solving them often means large gains for the company.

The problem with large problems is that they are easy to see and measure but not easy to fully understand. The size and scope of such problems make them desirable to solve but impossible to fully wrap a mind around.

And yet so many start here.

### ? ###

We start by seeing an easy and obvious answer to that grand problem that only needs some automation to work. It feels _cleaver_ and like somehow are experiences led us to see something other's could not. If we explain it to those managing over the problem they most likely agree that you have a wonderful plan.

But if we only look up to those who see the summary and output but do not look to those who do the work we are falling prey to [Selection Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias) and [Congruence Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congruence_bias).

### The Cost ###

Big problems require big solutions. Big solutions are expensive to design, develop, and deploy. Getting these wrong costs big money, and every instance I have seen of starting with the big problem has gotten it wrong.

That is not to say that every big problem first will fail, only that the odds are against them. If we are spending that kind of money, why bet against the odds?

## Examples of the Problem ##

## Shifting the View ##

Okay, so big problems are worth solving. I am not saying to forgo the big problems, but only saying forgo solving them directly. If we did into the work people do around, because of, or even adding to the problem we can start to find where to start.

The question we need to be asking is "What problem can I solve in two days that will make something better?" And, once we solve that problem we ask it again. The goal is to build up a compounding interest of value with everything we do.

There is an old riddle:

> Would you rather have $10K or a single penney that doubles its value every day for 30 days?

On the surface getting the $10K up front seems pretty good. But if you look at the penny, at the end of 30 days you will have over 5 Million dollars.

This is what we want. We want to have small solutions that incrementally grow effectiveness and efficiency.
