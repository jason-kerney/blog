I have spent most of my professional time developing internal software solutions. The type of applications that lubricate the machinery of internal business decision making. There is one problem I see over and over again. Something I have come to call the "Field of Dreams" approach to software. This is the idea, that because our customers are employees in the same company, that if we build it they will come.

The problem with this is that these projects tend to be "big bang" releases that "have no value until finished." They often miss the real problems and provide very little real value for very real and large costs.

These type of projects feel good to those who are designing them. After all they are intended to conquer the hard problems and the solution feels so _clever_. This emotional gratification clouds our judgement and makes it hard to see the blinding truth. If we do not have people pounding our door down for a solution then, probably no one wants it.

The second problem with these solutions is they are driven to solve "problems" that management or upper management sees, without the context of the smaller problems that contribute to it. [I wrote about looking for deeper problems]({{ related.url }})
