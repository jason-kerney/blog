## Where to Start

There are so many things to love about the world, but today I want to talk about things that make the world ugly and our presence in a world were ugly things happen. According to the [US Equal Opportunity Commission](https://www.eeoc.gov/data/sexual-harassment-our-nations-workplaces), between the fiscal years of 2018 and 2022 there were 98,411 harrasment charges filed. 27,291 of those were sexual harassment charges. You combine this with a report from [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2019-03-12-gartner-says-just-41-percent-of-workplace-misconduct-is-reported) that says that only 41% of all workplace misconduct is reported; and you have a problem.

I am not qualified to talk about the legal, or HR implications of these studies. If you are experiencing, or know someone experiencing this, please seek [help](https://civilrights.justice.gov/).

What I want to talk about is what is the ethical responsibility of the people not directly involved. Just to be clear, if you are the accused, a victem, a witness, an HR representive, or anyone with authority over those involed then this article is not for you. This is for the people who know those involved.

## Don't do anything

If you take action to try and rectify the situation you can only make it worse. I can only imagine that there could be legal ramifications depending on the outcomes of those actions. Again I am not a lawyer, so don't assume I know anything about the law. I am only speculating.

But beyond that, when you take action to help someone you are actively taking that person's control away. When dealing with harrasment, the person you are trying to help needs most to feel as if they are in control.
