## The Ugly Truth ##

There are so many things to love about the world, but today I want to talk about things that make the world ugly and our presence in a world were ugly things happen. According to the [US Equal Opportunity Commission](https://www.eeoc.gov/data/sexual-harassment-our-nations-workplaces), between the fiscal years of 2018 and 2022 there were 98,411 harrasment charges filed. 27,291 of those were sexual harassment charges. You combine this with a report from [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2019-03-12-gartner-says-just-41-percent-of-workplace-misconduct-is-reported) that says that only 41% of all workplace misconduct is reported; and you have a problem.

I am not qualified to talk about the legal, or HR implications of these studies. If you are experiencing, or know someone experiencing this, please seek [help](https://civilrights.justice.gov/).

If you take the numbers above there is an estimated 66K sexual misconduct cases at work in the US, and more then 38K are not reported. These assaults have a huge impact on our lives, our businesses, and our view of ourselves.

What I want to talk about is what is the ethical responsibility of the people not directly involved. Just to be clear, if you are the accused, a victim, a witness, an HR representative, or anyone with authority over those involved then this article is not for you. This is for the people who know those involved.
