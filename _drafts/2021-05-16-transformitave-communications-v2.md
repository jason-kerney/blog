Using Pasture Rob-Horne's graph on communication to talk about all "corporate" (to do with the body) communications.

I wrote about this concept back in 2015. Back when I wrote about it, I did not have as much context as I have now. So this is the second edition of that write up.

## Introduction

Pasture Rob Horne, of Pe√±asquitos Lutheran Church, introduced me to this interesting way to examine transformational messaging back in 2015. When he talked about the simple way to trouble shoot the impact of transformational messages, I knew he had discovered something golden. At that time I did not really understand how impactful it could be. Six years later, rereading what I wrote about the technique, it hits me that this is really an important tool for helping communicate in so many contexts. I believe Pasture Rob Horne really did discover a truth about conveying information.

## What is it?

We take the following two vector, four quadrant graph. The first vector is **Cultural Accessability** and the second vector is **Intended Meaning**.

### Cultural Accessability

Cultural Accessability is a measure of how easily it is for the intended audience to accept the message. When the accessability is at zero, it does not matter what the message is because the intended audience will not, and can not hear it. This is about understanding and respecting both the audience and their audience needs.

### Intended Meaning

Intended meaning is a measure of how much of the actual meaning is communicated. When this measure is equal to zero, the audience has no choice but to invent the meaning behind the message. This leaves the communication open to multiple disparate interpretations. This measure is about understanding and respecting the reasons behind the messaging.

## Confusion

When both Accessability and Meaning are low, you leave your audience with confusion. Here, they cannot digest what you are saying, nor is your message intact.

Since they cannot digest your message, and your message has no discernable meaning people will effectively flee from the message. It will be forgotten and ignored without any impact. It is noise and nothing more.

## Chaos

When Accessability is high, but meaning is low. You get chaos. Everyone hears the message and connects to it but there is no meaning that can be derived.

When a message falls in this quadrant the people who hear it desperately try to connect to the message; but with no discernable meaning, they create their own. People have trouble finding commonality to the meaning they gained from the message. What is worse, is since the meaning is personal, that means this type of messaging draws people who are already like minded to being closer. This happens at the same time as it pushes people with different points of view farther apart.

Messaging that falls in this quadrant can sow disharmony and malcontent all the while being pleasing to hear.

## Walled Garden

When accessability is low, but the meaning is high, you have a Walled Garden. People who want your message cannot access it.
