## TL; DR

-------

## Approached For a Change of Role

Mid April 2020, I was hired as a senior full-stack engineer, with the understanding that the company does not have coaches, and I would probably never hold that title. That was going to change a year later. The next year, at the end of April, I was approached by my manager and told about a team coaching position that the company wanted to fill. More then that I was asked if I wanted the job. It would be coaching the team I was already on.

## Deciding to Take the Job

I did as much do-diligence I was able to do on what the position would detail, its pay, and its growth potential. When I was satisfied I did something that scared me. I told the team about the offer, and gave them an anonymous form to tell me if they wanted me as a coach. I also informed them that if anyone said no, I would refuse the job, and be happy to do it.

## Handling the Fallout

No, one said no. So I applied, with the understanding that the company's processes would take a while, including a formal interview. Well, that did not go as anyone had planned. When the VP of the department heard that I applied, he approved my move into the role about 8 hours later. I was no longer a contributor, but a coach.

I finished the "sprint" as a developer and started making plans for my transition. This is where things again did not go as planned. Product, asked for me to remain a developer until they back fill my position. There were a lot of discussions, some of which I was privy. At the end of those discussions there was no guidance from upper management (which I was glad for).

I again took it to the team. I asked them "What was the greater need?" Did they need me more as a coach or more as a developer? The team discussed, and it was not unanimous. Then the team repaid my respect by asking me if this decision would effect my happiness?

After I assured them that:

1. This decision would not effect my happiness
1. This decision would be temporary if I stay as a developer

They chose to keep me as a developer, but only until my position is filled, _or_ the need for a coach becomes greater then the need for a senior developer. 

## A Relief

After deciding to remain a developer, there was a strange relief. We now had time to better plan my transition. I could do things that would better position me as a coach. I could also start to transition the things I do for the team. None of these things were considered when the team made the decision but were unexpected benefits.

## Summary

By giving space to respect the team, and ask them what they wanted from my career (as it directly effected them), I have reached a point that is in so many ways better then I could have done myself. Beyond that I have gained their trust not only as a senior developer, but also as a coach.
