## TL; DR

_Rites of Passage_ help people transition through periods of uncertainty by both giving them a known and accepted routine to focus on and by signaling to the individual and group that a change has happened. The use of rites of passage have been well documented in sociology and psychology in helping people with transitions. Therefore it makes since that businesses utilize these methods to help teams and individuals with change. Only, in my experience, they don't. This is a chance for companies, agile coaches, and individuals to start thinking about rites of passage and how they can be harnessed for good.

## What is a _Rite of Passage_

[Merriam-Webster's Dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rite%20of%20passage) defines it as:

> : a ritual, event, or experience that marks or constitutes a major milestone or change in a person's life

[Psychology Wiki](https://psychology.wikia.org/wiki/Rites_of_passage) has it defined as:

> A rite of passage is a ritual that marks a change in a person's social status. It is a universal phenomenon which can show anthropologists what social hierarchies, values and beliefs are important in specific cultures. Rites of passage are often ceremonies surrounding events such as childbirth, menarche or other milestones within puberty, coming of age, marriage, weddings, and death. Initiation ceremonies such as baptism, confirmation and bar or bat mitzvoth are considered important rites of passage. These may be viewed under the following headings 

[Psychology Dictionary Site](https://psychologydictionary.org/rite-of-passage/) defines it as:

> Ceremony signifying an event in an individual's life which indicates transition from one stage to the next, beginning in adolescence and progressing through adulthood. Any ritual performed in some secular or religious cultures at times when a person changes their status; for example, marriage and puberty. See also: birth rite; death rite; puberty rite.

What all of these have in common is that they are an experience that marks a major milestone or transition in someones life.

## Why do I care

Rites of passage help with reducing uncertainty for both the person who is going through the rite, and for both the groups who are effected by the person's transition. This means it helps the individual and groups manage the transition in a predicable and reliable way without negatively effecting the moral of any of the people effected by the transition. In other words it can help make a transition event more successful.

In [Need Link Here](./404)'s paper she talks about how simple things like getting to ready for work were a rite of daily passage to help someone transition into a work environment from a home environment. In [Need Link Here](./404)'s paper he describes how rites of passage are helping cancer patients deal with the stress of their diagnostics.

Yes none of the definitions specificity call out work transitions, but the stress we are trying to manage in work transitions falls somewhere between going to work and being diagnosed with cancer. As such, I do believe that well thought out rites of passage can help in the workplace.

## What Can I do

The first thing is to realize that even small transitions in the work place come with stress. It is the responsibility of leaders to think about and mitigate that stress as well as they can. The idea of a rite of passage can be a valuable tool in the tool kit of some one in a role.

## Be Warned

Any tool is just a tool. It can create something beneficial or harmful. [Need Link Here](./404) describes how some groups form rites of passage that can cause mental trauma and even death in participants. To prevent this we need to consider the people involved and the desired out comes. ([Ideas on what kinds of things to look for.]({{ related.url }})) And then run the idea past people of different ethnic groups, genders, and backgrounds looking for something that would make someone feel excluded or targeted.
