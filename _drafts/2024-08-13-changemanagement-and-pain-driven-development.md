## 1. Overview ##

Sometimes fixing a pain requires changes by those who do not feel the pain. Downstream consumers of a service may be impacted by people who add data, process, implementation, or any other thing to that service. These changes could legitimately make things easier and relieve pain for those individuals, but increase the pain for the people downstream. What do you do then? How do you manage a change that effects those who are not the recipient of that pain?

The answer is both simple and hard. The fact is you may never gain support of those who's actions cause pain, but do not feel that pain. But the only way to move forward is by realizing that this is a symptom of a pain that is being hidden. Remember in Pain Driven Development (PDD from now on.), one thing we need to be watchful for is when "curring" the pain causes a seemingly unrelated pain to appear somewhere else. This means that those solutions do not actually solve the underlying pain, they mask it.

## 2. Making the Pain Visible ##

To restate the problem more succinctly: Someone felt pain, a solution was implemented. They no longer felt pain, but other people are now feeling pain that seems unrelated. There are so many problems with this situation. The first is that the change of the current pain, needs to be inflicted upon people who are not feeling that pain. Thereby perpetuation the cycle. This is what is called a positive feedback loop. It is positive, not because it is beneficial, but because it keeps building energy until something breaks. Because the new problems feel to be unrelated to the "fix" this will continue growing, as trust of the system degrades and change fatigue comes into play.

This feedback cycle needs first to be recognized and stopped. If possible walk back the changes that caused the pain. If not possible, start at the basics. Make the pain visible. Make it hurt more. Make it hurt more people then those currently effected. The goal here is to get as many people as possible wanting to solve the pain because what ever is causing the pain is outside of the bounds of those who noticed it.

A pain that is distributed, is hard to diagnose. We need simpler models that analyze the system in a way that gives us a good enough diagnosis to allow us to try something that will give us insight. Because the pain is distributed across a system, according the the [Cynefin Framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_framework) we are working in a "Complex" system. In a complex system we:

1. Probe.
1. Then sense.
1. Then Respond.

Making the pain visible is the "Probing" part.

### 2.1 Sensing ###

Now that people feel the pain, and are probably unhappy due to it, resist the urge to start solutioning. Wait a bit. Listen to the various complaints. They will give you insight to what might be causing the original pain. Yes people will complain, because you have made them aware of a problem that wasn't theirs to begin with. But even that is a symptom. Look for a nexus, a place all these people join at. It can be in the organization structure. It can be in the nature of the complaints. It can even be in the people who pose the complaints. Listening and mapping out what you see is beneficial.

## 3. Remove the Probable Source ##

Now you have data to act on. Know, that your initial fix will be probably wrong in this case. But the goal is to find the actual cause. Here, you are acting on what the data says may be the cause of the pain. Once you remove that cause, wait. Listen. Does new pain suddenly appear after some time period? If so, go back to sensing and probing. Try rolling back the last change, and see if there is any new aspect of the pain you can make visible now that you have learned something.

## 4. Conclusion ##

Dealing with the problem that the removal of pain requires actions by someone else is not easy. Using PDD does give us a framework that is simple, even though it does not make it any easier. It gives us a model by which to make decisions, but is not a panacea that just solves your problems. Its real beauty comes with the fact that we can wrap our minds around how it works, and it can be applied in a way that respects the need for change management.
